Web Technology Project for CSIT 5th Semester

ToDoDo is a project management app that aims to streamline task management and project collaboration. ToDoDo provides both a Todo feature for task management and a Dashboard feature for project tracking. ToDoDo allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks according to different status (i.e. Todo, In Progress, Done). ToDoDo also aims to provide an overview of project progress and key performance indicators.
